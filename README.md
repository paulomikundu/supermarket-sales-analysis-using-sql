This project focuses on analyzing sales data from a supermarket using SQL queries to derive valuable insights for business decision-making. The dataset comprises transactional records capturing sales amounts, quantities, dates, and associated product and customer information. Through SQL queries, various analyses are conducted to understand overall sales performance, product category preferences, customer behavior, and seasonal trends. Key metrics such as total sales amount, sales quantity, top-selling products, and average sales per transaction are computed. Moreover, sales trends over time, including monthly and yearly comparisons, are examined to identify growth patterns and seasonal fluctuations. Additionally, the project delves into customer segmentation by analyzing repeat purchases and customer loyalty. These analyses provide actionable insights for inventory management, marketing strategies, and customer retention efforts. The project underscores the significance of leveraging SQL for comprehensive sales analysis, empowering businesses to make data-driven decisions to enhance profitability and operational efficiency in the supermarket retail sector
